### Introduction

Operational Deflection Shape Analysis, known as ODS analysis, provide very
useful information for understanding and evaluating the dynamic behavior of
rotating machinery, influenced by their own operating forces. ODS analysis
identifies how much a machine is vibrating, where are located the most vibrating 
points, and how is the vibration phase of each point relative to others
[18]. Those information can be used in fault diagnosis for rotating machines,
such as: unbalance, misalignment and structural looseness.

Accelerometers are commonly used for ODS analysis, however, many
drawbacks should be considered. Accelerometers can provide extremely accurate 
vibration measurements, but when the structure is small compared
to the size of the accelerometer, the presence of the added mass can affect
the result. Also, the structure should be densely instrumented in order to
achieve good ODS analysis, and simultaneous measurements should be done
in a multi-channel acquisition system. These requires lots of transducers and
relative sophisticated signal conditioning and acquiring equipment, which
can be very expensive.

In this work, ODS analysis data are measured with an ordinary commercial
video camera, that acquires visible light reflected from the rotating
machinery as a method of measuring vibration. To do so, the camera has a
high-resolution and high-frequency video shooting rate in order to properly
translate minimum displacements to the video file. This work also proposes
an algorithm that can visualise ODS by the magnification of motions in
a video, inside a certain frequency band.
